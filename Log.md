### Day 2: 23/09/2020, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Built an Hamburger Overlay Menu entirely from CSS(followed a tutorial ofcourse)
2. Completed Functions Module from Wesbos's Beginner JS Course. Got to learn new things about functions, like, Arrow Funtions, Anonymous Functions, IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) & Callback Functions.

**Thoughts**: Was able to understand flexbox's row/column concept actually today. Also shoudl write more functions to get a hang of it.
